Chapter 33.
These are the journeys of the Israelites, who went out of the land of Egypt by their divisions under the authority of Moses and Aaron. 
Moses recorded their departures according to their journeys, by the commandment of the Lord; now these are their journeys according to their departures. 
They departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the day after the Passover the Israelites went out defiantly in plain sight of all the Egyptians. 
Now the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn, whom the Lord had killed among them; the Lord also executed judgments on their gods.

Aaron the priest ascended Mount Hor at the command of the Lord, and he died there in the fortieth year after the Israelites had come out of the land of Egypt on the first day of the fifth month. 
Now Aaron was 123 years old when he died in Mount Hor.

They traveled from the mountains of Abarim and camped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan River across from Jericho. 
They camped by the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth as far as Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab. 
The Lord spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho. He said: 
“Speak to the Israelites and tell them, ‘When you have crossed the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 
you must drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you. Destroy all their carved images, all their molten images, and demolish their high places. 
You must dispossess the inhabitants of the land and live in it, for I have given you the land to possess it. 
You must divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families. To a larger group you must give a larger inheritance, and to a smaller group you must give a smaller inheritance. Everyone’s inheritance must be in the place where his lot falls. You must inherit according to your ancestral tribes. 
But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land before you, then those whom you allow to remain will be irritants in your eyes and thorns in your side, and will cause you trouble in the land where you will be living. 
And what I intended to do to them I will do to you.”
