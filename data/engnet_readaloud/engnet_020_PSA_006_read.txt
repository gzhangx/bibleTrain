Psalm.
Chapter 6.
For the music director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments, according to the sheminith style; a psalm of David. Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger! Do not discipline me in your raging fury! 
Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am frail! Heal me, Lord, for my bones are shaking! 
I am absolutely terrified, and you, Lord – how long will this continue? 
Relent, Lord, rescue me! Deliver me because of your faithfulness! 
For no one remembers you in the realm of death, In Sheol who gives you thanks? 
I am exhausted as I groan; all night long I drench my bed in tears; my tears saturate the cushion beneath me. 
My eyes grow dim from suffering; they grow weak because of all my enemies. 
Turn back from me, all you who behave wickedly, for the Lord has heard the sound of my weeping! 
The Lord has heard my appeal for mercy; the Lord has accepted my prayer. 
May all my enemies be humiliated and absolutely terrified! May they turn back and be suddenly humiliated!
