Psalm.
Chapter 46.
For the music director; by the Korahites; according to the alamoth style; a song. God is our strong refuge; he is truly our helper in times of trouble. 
For this reason we do not fear when the earth shakes, and the mountains tumble into the depths of the sea, 
when its waves crash and foam, and the mountains shake before the surging sea. (Selah) 
The river’s channels bring joy to the city of God, the special, holy dwelling place of the sovereign One. 
God lives within it, it cannot be moved. God rescues it at the break of dawn. 
Nations are in uproar, kingdoms are overthrown. God gives a shout, the earth dissolves. 
The Lord who commands armies is on our side! The God of Jacob is our protector! (Selah) 
Come! Witness the exploits of the Lord, who brings devastation to the earth! 
He brings an end to wars throughout the earth; he shatters the bow and breaks the spear; he burns the shields with fire. 
He says, “Stop your striving and recognize that I am God! I will be exalted over the nations! I will be exalted over the earth!” 
The Lord who commands armies is on our side! The God of Jacob is our protector! (Selah)
