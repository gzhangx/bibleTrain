Psalm.
Chapter 149.
Praise the Lord! Sing to the Lord a new song! Praise him in the assembly of the godly! 
Let Israel rejoice in their Creator! Let the people of Zion delight in their king! 
Let them praise his name with dancing! Let them sing praises to him to the accompaniment of the tambourine and harp! 
For the Lord takes delight in his people; he exalts the oppressed by delivering them. 
Let the godly rejoice because of their vindication! Let them shout for joy upon their beds! 
May they praise God while they hold a two-edged sword in their hand, 
in order to take revenge on the nations, and punish foreigners. 
They bind their kings in chains, and their nobles in iron shackles, 
and execute the judgment to which their enemies have been sentenced. All his loyal followers will be vindicated. Praise the Lord!
