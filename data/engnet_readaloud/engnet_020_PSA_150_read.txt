Psalm.
Chapter 150.
Praise the Lord! Praise God in his sanctuary! Praise him in the sky, which testifies to his strength! 
Praise him for his mighty acts! Praise him for his surpassing greatness! 
Praise him with the blast of the horn! Praise him with the lyre and the harp! 
Praise him with the tambourine and with dancing! Praise him with stringed instruments and the flute! 
Praise him with loud cymbals! Praise him with clanging cymbals! 
Let everything that has breath praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
