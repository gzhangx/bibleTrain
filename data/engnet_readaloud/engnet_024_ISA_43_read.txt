Isaiah.
Chapter 43.
Now, this is what the Lord says, the one who created you, O Jacob, and formed you, O Israel: “Don’t be afraid, for I will protect you. I call you by name, you are mine. 
When you pass through the waters, I am with you; when you pass through the streams, they will not overwhelm you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not harm you. 
For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your deliverer. I have handed over Egypt as a ransom price, Ethiopia and Seba in place of you. 
Since you are precious and special in my sight, and I love you, I will hand over people in place of you, nations in place of your life. 
Don’t be afraid, for I am with you. From the east I will bring your descendants; from the west I will gather you. 
I will say to the north, ‘Hand them over!’ and to the south, ‘Don’t hold any back!’ Bring my sons from distant lands, and my daughters from the remote regions of the earth, 
everyone who belongs to me, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed – yes, whom I made! 
Bring out the people who are blind, even though they have eyes, those who are deaf, even though they have ears! 
All nations gather together, the peoples assemble. Who among them announced this? Who predicted earlier events for us? Let them produce their witnesses to testify they were right; let them listen and affirm, ‘It is true.’ 
You are my witnesses,” says the Lord, “my servant whom I have chosen, so that you may consider and believe in me, and understand that I am he. No god was formed before me, and none will outlive me. 
I, I am the Lord, and there is no deliverer besides me. 
I decreed and delivered and proclaimed, and there was no other god among you. You are my witnesses,” says the Lord, “that I am God. 
From this day forward
