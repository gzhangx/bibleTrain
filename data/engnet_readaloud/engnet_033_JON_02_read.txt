Jonah.
Chapter 2.
Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the stomach of the fish 
and said, “I called out to the Lord from my distress, and he answered me; from the belly of Sheol I cried out for help, and you heard my prayer. 
You threw me into the deep waters, into the middle of the sea; the ocean current engulfed me; all the mighty waves you sent swept over me. 
I thought I had been banished from your sight, that I would never again see your holy temple! 
Water engulfed me up to my neck; the deep ocean surrounded me; seaweed was wrapped around my head. 
I went down to the very bottoms of the mountains; the gates of the netherworld barred me in forever; but you brought me up from the Pit, O Lord, my God. 
When my life was ebbing away, I called out to the Lord, and my prayer came to your holy temple. 
Those who worship worthless idols forfeit the mercy that could be theirs. 
But as for me, I promise to offer a sacrifice to you with a public declaration of praise; I will surely do what I have promised. Salvation belongs to the Lord!” 
Then the Lord commanded the fish and it disgorged Jonah on dry land.
